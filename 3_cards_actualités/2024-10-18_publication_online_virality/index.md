L'ouvrage ['Online Virality, Spread and Influence'](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783111311371/html?lang=en#overview)  dirigé par V. Schafer et f. Pailler, accueille le chapitre "The Womb, the Banknote and the Trolley. Elements of French Anti-Gender Visual Culture", rédigé par Virginie Julliard, fred Pailler, Félix Alié et Victor Écrement. Ce chapitre constitue un exemple des méthodes collaboratives et du type d'études que le projet Semiosis a contribué à développer. 

Abstract:
This chapter explores the development of visual vernaculars embedded in tweets that have been published by the French anti-gender movement. The latter took shape during the three following events: the law legalising same-sex marriage in France (2013); the moral panic about the concept of gender (2014–2018); the law opening assisted reproductive technology to women in same-sex couples and single women (2021). After the presentation of the growth of the anti-gendermovement as a new political force in France over the past decade, this chapter addresses the key methodological issue of counting and identifying images byproposing a typology of their similarities and variations. In the last section, we consider an iconic pattern associating visual elements related to babies, wombs and money or trading, and show how it became persistent over time and increasingly fuelled the visual material on which the anti-gender movement has built its communication campaigns against the “commodification of living beings”.
